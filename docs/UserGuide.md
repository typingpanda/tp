## Introduction

Welcome to Big PC Part-Picker (BigPP)
BigPP is a command-line application designed for PC enthusiasts and professional PC builders who aim to:

- streamline the [process](#commands) of managing computer builds
- verify the [compatibility](#compatibility-check) of selected components.

This developer-oriented guide offers a comprehensive overview of the various commands and features available in BigPP. It is intended for users who are familiar with command-line interfaces.
If you encounter unfamiliar terminology in this guide, please refer to the [Glossary](#glossary) for a list of terms and their definitions.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Getting Started

1. Install [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) for your operating system. If you are unsure about how to do this, you can refer to the [Java installation guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) or consult a search engine.
2. Download the latest version of `BigPP` from
   [the releases page](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to an empty folder you want to use as the _home folder_ This will be the folder in which BigPP will store all of its user data.
4. Right click inside the _home folder_ and open a terminal at that location
5. Run the command `java -jar BigPP.jar` to start the app.
6. Refer to the [Commands](#Commands) below to try out the application!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Upon successful initialization of the program for the first time, you would be greeted by the following, assuming you do not currently have a user.json file in your _home folder_

```

#### **Edit Command**

Usage: `edit PC_INDEX`

Functionality: Enters PCBuilder mode for the PC with index `PC_INDEX`.

Example:

Chassis    : - Not Selected -

What would you like to do?
===================================================
Currently editing PC: NEWPC
```

Notes: If the PC that the user has selected to edit is a `PREBUILT_PC`, the application would create a copy of it and mark it as a `CUSTOM_PC`. This is because we provide the prebuilts as a reference for the user, and not for editing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Delete Command**

Usage: `delete PC_INDEX`

Functionality: Deletes the PC with index `PC_INDEX`

#### **Filter Command**

Usage: `filter FILTER_FLAGS`

Available flags:

> `-name PC_NAME`
>
> `-price /from PC_START_PRICE /to PC_END_PRICE`
>
> `-built PC_ISCOMPLETE`
>
> `-clear`

Functionality:
The following explains the functionality of filtering by each flag:

- `-name PC_NAME` will filter the PC List by the given name
- `price /from PC_START_PRICE /to PC_END_PRICE` will filter the PC List by a given price range
- `-built PC_ISCOMPLETE` will filter the PC List by built of either complete or incomplete
- `-clear` will clear all filters that were applied previously

Example: filter the PC List by the name of intermediate, in the range of starting price from 1000 to 3000 and is a completed build

> input: filter -name intermediate -price /from 1000 /to 3000 -built complete

```
===================================================
PC viewer
Here is the list of PC Builds:
    2.Prebuilt-PC: [intermediate] - $1499.36/infinite - Complete
What would you like to do?
===================================================
Filter completed
```

Notes: The flags can by strung together _in any order_ such as `filter -price /from 1000 /to 3000 -name intermediate -built complete`. However, if the `-clear` flag is detected, this will take **precedence** and remove all filters regardless of other flags.
Please note that you will still be able to edit the PCs that are not filtered as the filter is simply only for easier viewing of the PCs which you would like to edit.

## Additional Features

### Compatibility Check

BigPP will check if your components that you added are compatible with each other. There are a few ways that BigPP will ensure your PC components are all compatible with each other.

1. `CHASSIS` must always be of a bigger or same `FORMFACTOR` than the inner components such as `GPU`, `PSU` etc, this check is ignored if your chassis is not added.
2. Total power consumption of all `COMPONENT_TYPE` components in your build apart from `PSU` must be below 80% of the power supplied by the `PSU` selected to ensure there is enough power in your build, this check is ignored if your psu is not added.
3. Your `BUDGET` always needs to be larger than the total price of your entire build, this check is ignored if your budget is infinite.
4. Your `CPU` and `MOTHERBOARD` needs to have the same `SOCKET`.

Based on the rules stated above, the compatibility checker will throw the user error messages if he tries to add any component which breaks the rules, and suggest changes that the user can make to avoid adding incompatible components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Example: The `CPU` current added has a socket **LGA1200** and the new `MOTHERBOARD` that the user wants to add has a socket **AM5**.

> input: custom motherboard newmobo\|AMD\|10\|atx\|AM5\|10

### Advanced User Guide
You are able to edit the Json file to change the data of your custom built PCs as an advanced user. However if any formatting error is created due to this, the program would prompt:
```
Error loading user PCs, please backup your user json then delete it.
```
This will allow the application to create a new user json for you to freely use the app once again, and the backed-up json file will be there for you to refer to in case there is important information still there. 
If certain attributes of the components have been deleted, such as "name", "price" etc, the application would still be able to load up, but these attributes would be set as null values. In order to change back these values, either add a custom component with the updated attributes, or exit the application and edit the values inside the user json file.
